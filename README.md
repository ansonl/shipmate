USNA Shipmate server backend
===================

This is the server backend of the USNA Shipmate pickup service for midshipmen. This program stores pickups from the Shipmate mobile app so that van drivers can find the mobile app user's location and pick them up faster. 

How to use
-------------

If you want to use Shipmate, just download the app and head out on liberty. 
This repository is only of interest if you would like to view the Shipmate server backend code and modify it.  

> **Note:**

> - `checkMD5()` authenticates the driver to perform actions such as confirming, completing, and canceling pickups. Change the md5 hash to one of your choosing if you are going to test this.
